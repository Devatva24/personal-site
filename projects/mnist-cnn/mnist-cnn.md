## Overview

Built a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
Tested multiple architectures (Dense Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks) and achieved the best results with a CNN.

## Techniques Used

- Data normalization and reshaping
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with pooling layers
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualization of training history (loss & accuracy curves)

## Results

- Achieved over 96.80% test accuracy with a simple neural network
- Fast training and inference time
- Correctly classified most handwritten digits with high confidence
