## Overview

Built a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using Python and Scikit-Learn.  
Tested multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) and achieved strong results with Random Forest.

## Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model evaluation using ROC, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results

Achieved over **99% accuracy** with a high recall score on fraudulent transactions.
