## Showcase

Probably cooler if I show the final product here before talking about how I made it.
That's Dad in the pic btw

![flamethrower outside shooting flames](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/flamethrower.jpg)

The image above was the first version of the project. It had 4 outlets. Each outlet had a constant flow of gas which was ignited as a pilot light. Each of them also had a solenoid controlled auxiliary line that would allow more gas to flow into the outlet section. Controlling these solenoids would make big flames come out the top.
This particular version had a lower pressure gas regulator than later versions, and the solenoids were hard wired to a bunch of buttons on a breadboard.

Later on I moved to a larger gas regulator and controlled the solenoids with the map files from BeatSaber, as shown below

## Inspiration

Back when I had more time on my hands, I came across this awesome video

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JY3MAoB89xM?si=olV4eU6XhA3sr_Ps" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And I thought that was super cool, and luckily dad thought it was cool enough to help out.

This was my first proper project that went bigger than a few scripts.

## The plan

I was only 15 and had no idea what I was doing. Software and electronics wise I could figure it out, but I couldn't weld or do anything with gas. So, thank you Dad for doing all the welding and making sure we didn't explode üëç.

But I knew where to start with the control. I had used an Arduino before which was a start.

I decided I was going to have control over the flames with some buttons and a Guitar Hero guitar like I'd seen in the inspo video. But I had also just discovered the world of virtual reality and a game called Beatsaber. For some context, this is Beatsaber below

![Beatsaber gameplay](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/beatsaber-gameplay.gif){width=400px}

It's virtual reality Fruit Ninja Guitar Hero. The blocks come flying at you in sync with a song, and you chop them up in the right direction. These blocks would become instructions for the solenoids later on ...

## Version 1 - Manual control

In conjunction with the team pyrotechnical engineer (Dad), I was advised that controlling gas was done with a solenoid, and that the propane technician (Dad) would pipe up the main propane feed into one side of the solenoid, I would turn it on, and there would be flames out the top. Cool.

After I had confidently selected some $10 gas solenoids off of wish.com to control the whole thing, I ventured into the realm of relay control

<div>

<img alt="flamethrower outlet from side" src="/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/outlet-side.jpg" width=300px>

</div>

I was just using the generic Raspberry Pi GPIO ports to control each channel individually. Note that I had only ever used the basic Arduino breakout kits with jumpers. So, naive me went and wired it up like a toy.

And then I set it all up outside with a breadboard and some buttons.

![control setup outside](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/outdoor-button-setup.jpg){width=300px}

Then it was time to turn to more *fancy* control methods

### Guitar Hero Controller

For those who haven't played Guitar Hero before, there are 5 buttons on the top of the Guitar neck which are pressed while you play, and the signals are sent to a USB dongle which is normally plugged into a console.

![holding Guitar Hero Guitar in front of flamethrower](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/guitar-hero-guitar.jpg){width=200px}

I was lucky enough to find a library that let me poll the state of those buttons right in my Python script. I would add the code if I found it, but I think it has been lost to the `.gitignore` aether.

Regardless, here's a video of me using the controller to actuate the solenoids.

### Beatsaber

Now, this was probably my favourite.
Remembering back to the gameplay of a Guitar Hero Fruit Ninja game

![Beatsaber gameplay](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/beatsaber-gameplay.gif){width=400px}

Each of the blocks in a map are stored internally with a timestamp, row and column value inside a `.dat` file

```json
{
    "_time": 173,
  "_BPMChanges": [...],
  "_events": [...],
  "_notes": [
    ...
      {
      "_time": 9.875,   // time relative to bpm
      "_lineIndex": 2,  // column
      "_lineLayer": 0,  // row
      "_type": 0,
      "_cutDirection": 1
    },
    ...
  ],
  "_obstacles": [],
  "_bookmarks": []
}
```

If we only consider the `_time` and `_lineIndex` (column) value, we can convert this data into a set of timestamped bursts for 4 different flames.

![Beatsaber block alignment row illustration](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/beatsaber-grids.gif){width=400px}

So I made a script that would go through all the `_notes` in a game file and extract the time and column value into a massive list like this

```python
[
[9.875, 0, 0, 1, 1], # time, flame1, flame2, flame3, flame4
[11, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[12, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[12.938, 1, 0, 1, 0],
...
]
```

In the first list of the 2D list above `[9.875, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, the `9.875` is the time the block appears, and the set of 4 numbers after are the boolean values for the relays. The `0, 0, 1, 1` means that the 2 most left relays remain off whilst the 2 far right ones are on.

Then, it's just a matter of starting a software stopwatch and triggering a burst of flames each time a block is detected

```python
b = datetime.datetime.now()
c = (b - a)
    
stp = "{:.3f}".format(c.seconds + c.microseconds * 1e-6)
stopwatch = float(stp)*(_bpm/60)
```

Note that `stopwatch` is relative to the BPM by multiplying the seconds (`1.123`) by the BPM scale (`_bpm / 60`).
In fact, looking back at this code in particular, I think it might have a few issues.

### Struggle

I would also like to note that I was so incredibly bad at coding that I re-invented the `continue` keyword by accident. I think this took me like 1 hour of debugging. Clearly my first experience with it's use case

**Before learning about `continue`**

```python
for m in time_hold: 
    
    holder_list[0]=round(notes[m]['_time'],3)
    _count=1
    i_finished = False      
    
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 0 and channel_1_set == False:
        holder_list[1] = 1
        i_finished = True
        channel_1_set = True
    elif channel_1_set == False:holder_list[1] = 0
    
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 1 and i_finished == False and channel_2_set == False:
        holder_list[2] = 1
        i_finished = True
        channel_2_set = True
    elif i_finished == True and channel_2_set == False:holder_list[2] = 0
    
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 2 and i_finished == False and channel_3_set == False:
        holder_list[3] = 1
        i_finished = True
        channel_3_set = True
    elif i_finished == True and channel_3_set == False:holder_list[3] = 0
    
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 3 and i_finished == False and channel_4_set == False:
        holder_list[4] = 1
        i_finished = True
        channel_4_set = True
    elif i_finished == True and channel_4_set == False:holder_list[4] = 0

form.append(holder_list)
channel_1_set = False
channel_2_set = False
channel_3_set = False
channel_4_set = False

time_hold = []
time_hold.append(i)
```

**After learning about `continue`**

```python
for m in time_hold:                     
    holder_list[0]=round(notes[m]['_time'],3)

    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 0:
        holder_list.extend([1,0,0,0])
        continue
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 1:
        holder_list.extend([0,1,0,0])
        continue
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 2:
        holder_list.extend([0,0,1,0])
        continue
    if notes[m]['_lineIndex'] == 3:
        holder_list.extend([0,0,0,1])
        
form.append(holder_list)
time_hold = []
time_hold.append(i)
```

The codebase obviously wasn't perfect, but in the end it did everything I wanted it to do with no issues.

### BPM RGB coloring

At the time of this project I was obsessed with ansi colors in the terminal (I still think they're cool). I decided that I wanted to color the BPM of the song to represent it's pace.

![numbers 1 to 300 colored white to green to red](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/BPM-colored-text.png)

Obviously a song at 60 BPM is tame, and a song at 300 is bonkers. I set some basic thresholds for color ranges and began playing with the Google color picker. From there, I made a [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/o2gcqlowq6) with some outrageous ramps to pick individual Red, Green and Blue values based on the BPM (x axis).

![screen capture of a Desmos function scanning over different BPM values](/projects/musical-flamethrower/images/desmos.gif)

I ended up asking my Math teachers (shout-out to Mr Y and Miss H) how I could connect the threshold values of `0`, `110`, `185` and `255` to intersect with the function. This alone taught me about function translation, scaling and piecewise notation.

It looks cool (although it's over complicated) as a piecewise too

$$
f : \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3, \quad
x \mapsto
(\textcolor{red}{r}, \textcolor{green}{g}, \textcolor{blue}{b})
\begin{cases}
(0,0,0), & x < 0 \\[0.75em]

\left(0, \dfrac{255}{110}\cdot\dfrac{x^5}{146410000}, 0\right), & 0 \le x < 110 \\[1em]

\left(\dfrac{255}{75}\cdot\dfrac{(x-110)^3}{5625}, 255, 0\right), & 110 \le x < 185 \\[1em]

\left(255, 255 - \dfrac{255}{75}\cdot\dfrac{(x-185)^3}{5635}, 0\right), & 185 \le x < 260 \\[1em]

(255,0,0), & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## Final words

I am so glad I had Dad to help me with this. This kinda started my love for programming and electronics in general.

If anyone reading this wants to help build a new new one, please message me :)
