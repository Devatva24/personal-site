## Inspiration

Back when I had more time on my hands, I came across this awesome video

And I thought, that's sick. So did Dad.

## The plan

I was only 15 and had no idea what I was doing. Software and electronics wise I could figure it out, but I couldn't weld or do anything with gas. So, thank you Dad for doing all the welding and making sure we didn't explode üëç.

But I knew where to start with the control. I had used an Arduino before, and I knew about solenoids.

I decided I was going to have control over the flames with a Guitar Hero guitar, and then not long after that I figured the 4 block lanes from BeatSaber matched the 4 solenoid channels I wanted on the flamethrower.
